Hey there! I'm Seth H, a 15-year-old self-taught programmer. I first dabbled in computer programming when I was seven years old, but only got into it seriously when I was about eleven. My main interests are coding and various forms of digital arts, but I also love reading and listening to music. I support the Serial/Oxford Comma.

My primary programming languages are JavaScript, C++, Processing, Python, and Lua. I also really love programming embedded systems, including game consoles, TI calculators, and Arduinos. I have many projects that I haven't yet published to GitHub but I'm working on that :). I use Visual Studio Code as my main IDE, with my favorite coding fonts being [Fantasque Sans Mono](https://github.com/belluzj/fantasque-sans) and [Comic Code](https://tosche.net/fonts/comic-code).

Here's these cool card thingies that people put on their profiles that give 5xx errors sometimes:
