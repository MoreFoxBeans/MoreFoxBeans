# 👋🏼 sussy among us 🥶🥶❄️

Hey there! I'm Seth H, a 14-year-old self-taught programmer. I've been coding since I was seven years old, but only started getting serious when I was about 10. My main interests are coding, graphic design, and I also love reading and listening to music. I support the Serial/Oxford Comma.

My main programming languages are JavaScript, C, Processing, Python, and Lua. I also really love programming embedded systems, including game consoles, TI calculators, and Arduinos. I have many projects that I haven't yet published to GitHub but I'm working on that :). I use Visual Studio Code as my main IDE, with my favorite coding fonts being Input and Comic Mono.
