# 👋🏼 sussy among us 🥶🥶❄

Hey there! I'm Seth H, a 14-year-old self-taught programmer. I've been coding since I was seven years old, but only started getting serious when I was about 10. My main interests are coding, graphic design, and I also love reading.

My main programming languages are JavaScript, Processing 4, and Python. I've also written software in C, C++, and Lua, but I'm not hosting any of those on GitHub atm. I use Visual Studio Code as my main IDE. My favorite coding fonts are Comic Mono and Jetbrains Mono.
