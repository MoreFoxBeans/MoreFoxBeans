## Currently working on:
- Re-doing my entire website under a new domain (stay tuned!)
- School projects

Nice to meet you! I'm Seth, a 15-year-old designer and programmer (I first dabbled in computer programming when I was seven, but only got into it seriously when I was about eleven). My main interests are coding and various forms of digital arts, and I also love listening to music and reading.

My fav programming languages are JavaScript, Python, C++, Processing, and Lua. I also really love programming embedded systems like game consoles, TI calculators, and Arduinos. I use Visual Studio Code as my IDE, with my favorite coding fonts being [Fantasque Sans Mono](https://github.com/belluzj/fantasque-sans) and [Comic Code](https://tosche.net/fonts/comic-code).
