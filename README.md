# 👋🏼 Hello there!

I'm Seth H, a 13 year programmer. I like to code, do graphic design, and Windows 10 skinning. My favorite programming languages are JavaScript, Python, and Processing 3. I use Photoshop for graphic design and Stardock WindowBlinds for Windows skinning. Whenever I get tired from coding (which is never often), I play Minecraft, Roblox, and Mini Motorways. My favorite book series and the one I'm currently reading is Wings of Fire by Tui T. Sutherland.
